These Sass, Typescript and Vue files are bundled with the help of webpack into public folder. To see the changes made into these files use the command `npm run watch`.

## Queue

IATI Publisher uses Laravel Queue for specific purposes like importing activities and bulk publishing activities. The queue uses redis as queue driver. The configuration for redis and queue can be setup locally in three ways:
- Manually running artisan command `php artisan horizon`. [Horizon](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/horizon#configuration) can be paused with `php artisan horizon:pause` command and terminated with `php artisan horizon:terminate` command. To check the status of horizon, use command `php artisan horizon:status`.

- Using [supervisorctl](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/queues#supervisor-configuration) to run queue

- Manually running artisan command `php artisan queue:work` or `php artisan queue:listen` to start queue worker. The command `php artisan queue:work` needs to be restarted every time the changes are made in the code. To run the queue continuously, without having to restart on changes, use command `php artisan queue:listen`.

## Test

The application uses PHPUnit, the built-in testing support of Laravel for unit and feature tests. The test files are included within `tests` folder. Following commands can be used to run test cases:

- Run all tests: `php artisan test`
- Run specific test class: `php artisan test --filter [Test Class]`
- Run specific test method from a class : `php artisan test --filter [Test Class]::[Method Name]`
