The project will aim to provide capacity in terms of skills and knowledge to enable women in selected value chains to trade formally, improve access finance and markets.  \n\n (ii)Increase trade value for women: According to studies, women trade in commodities with little or no value addition and are therefore disadvantaged as their returns on trade remain low. The project\u2019s objective is to support women traders to access high value markets through trading in clusters\/cooperatives and other groupings that support consolidation of resources and collective bargaining for cost reduction. The project will provide institutional capacity support to the Chamber of Women to enable it to provide much needed stewardship to women traders. \nThe project with be implemented though a grant to Rwanda Women\u2019s Chamber who are a national umbrella \/apex representing women entrepreneurs.

licensing and inspection of imported goods in regulated sectors such as electronics and allied goods; and the protection of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs). It is within this context that TMEA is extending its support to RURA  to implement an ICT enabled solution that will focus on addressing how importers and exporters in RURA-regulated sectors comply

comprehensive TMEA-funded berths condition assessment and rehabilitation study observed that Berths 11-14, constructed in the 1950s to service conventional cargo, were in critical condition, with foundational piles and the underlying berth structure severely corroded, compromising the safety of users. Furthermore, the berths are increasingly being used for container handling although they do not have the requisite equipment such as ship -to-shore gantry cranes. Consequently, only vessels with their own ship cranes use these berths, leading to low berth productivity levels. The berths originally were also equipped with warehouse facilities alongside the quayside. KPA has since removed the warehouses and paved the yards behind these Berths providing limited container yard storage capacity.  The Berth 11-14 construction, part of Mombasa Port Productivity Improvement Programme Phase 2, will seek to increase KPA\u2019s container handling capacity; catalyse an increase in KPA\u2019s productivity levels by more than 20% to support the growing trade and creation of employment in East Africa and stimulate a reduction in the relative intensity in tC02 per tonne of cargo. \n\nThe Mombasa Port Productivity Improvement Programme will implement a combination of infrastructure and productivity related interventions will be implemented.

Rwanda programme has recorded significant success from the strategy I women and trade project specifically in the establishment of the cooperatives. This project will therefore build on this success and replicate good business models and lessons learned in the establishment of cooperatives for WCBT and replicate this for other segments like urban traders. Despite the significant results achieved in the ProFemme project facilitating women cross border traders in Rwanda to trade through cooperatives, other women traders continue to trade in low volumes and low value commodities and services which reduces the profitability of their trade. In strategy Il, this project will have a stronger focus on increasing trade in higher value goods so as to increase the trade value of the targeted traders\/SMEs by addressing challenges faced in specific sectors\/ value chains. The project will replicate the lessons learnt while the target group will be expanded to cover small and medium women owned enterprises to access export markets. The project specifically seeks to achieve the objectives below:\n(i) Increase access to information and trade support services: Small business owners (predominantly women) state that the high tax burden in the formal sector forces them to operate informally. This is further demonstrated by the limited access to affordable finance for women traders. In 2011, 28.2% of women had bank accounts at formal financial institutions in comparison to 37.5% of men. Even where the Simplified Trade Regime is implemented, in order to benefit from the regime, an exporter must be VAT registered. Given that they trade informally, the majority are unable to meet this criterion. l The project will aim to provide capacity in terms of skills and knowledge to enable women in selected value chains to trade formally, improve access finance and markets.\n(ii)lncrease trade value for women: The Rwanda National Cross Border Trade Strategy confirms that men trade primarily in capital intensive goods (e.g. manufactured goods), while women trade in commodities with little or no value addition and are therefore disadvantaged as their returns on trade remain low. The project's objective is to support women traders to access high value markets through trading in clusters\/cooperatives and other groupings that support consolidation of resources and collective bargaining for cost reduction.","language":""}]}},"activity_status":2,"activity_date":{"0":{"date":"2018-08-01","type":2,"narrative":[{"narrative":"","language":""}]},"8":{"date":"2018-08-01","type":1,"narrative":[{"narrative":"","language":""}]},"12":{"date":"2023-06-30","type":3,"narrative":[{"narrative":"","language":""}]}},"participating_organization":[{"organization_role":4,"identifier":"","type":4,"ref":"","crs_channel_code":"TradeMark

capacity-building opportunities to improve the quality of logistics services; (ii) enabling access to credible data to overcome information deficits and building stronger advocacy; and (iii) creating third party logistics infrastructure to allow them to provide end-to-end services to their clients.\n\nSpecifically, the programme consists of three sub-components: 1) setting up a truck driver training programme; 2) setting up a warehouse operator training programme; and, 3) expanding the successful EACFFPC training to other regional economic centres.\n\nThe programme is expected to lead to

international trade the supply chain that links the process of:  producing, manufacturing, moving and marketing of goods in international trade involves several business processes, regulatory

The more borders cargo has to transit through, the more challenging it is to move the goods from source to destination.  The associated constraints with this kind of supply chain requires the establishment of seamless linkages among the supply chain actors to enable them to act more efficiently and transparently to lower the time and costs associated with the international trade process.\n\nThe programme aims at developing and implementing information sharing and exchange frameworks based on ICT to improve the information systems used by different supply chain actors by giving them direct access to relevant information. This will result in optimal transmission and use of information, enhanced visibility, improved transparency and predictability, and ultimately increase efficiency in the supply chains used by EATN businesses.  It will also contribute to improved competitiveness of EATN trade and in particular

the last 20 years, there has been a drive towards tariff reduction under the auspices of the WTO. As a result, there has been a 15% reduction in applied tariffs, resulting in the current average tariff of 9% applied by WTO members. Given the substantial reduction in tariffs, focus in trade facilitation has now shifted to non-tariff measures that impede trade, and in many cases, have a higher impact than the tariffs. Non-tariff measures include discriminatory regulations, procedures and fees that are sometimes used in a protectionist manner. There is also widespread use of quality parameters (also referred to as technical barriers to trade), that go beyond the legitimate requirements, and have the impact of impeding trade. These measures include standards, product specifications such as product characteristics, production methods, packaging or labelling, and related processes that are used to verify compliance. \n\nThis programme aims to create an environment that supports compliance to Standards and Technical Regulations, without necessarily creating additional barriers to trade. Its aim is to enhance the capacity of regulatory agencies at the national levels, such as National Bureaux of Standards (NSBs), Food and Drug Agencies (FDAs), and other affiliate agencies, to enforce compliance to Standards and Technical Regulations, while facilitating trade. The programme also seeks to increase product, process and system certification for firms and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as a means to demonstrate compliance to voluntary and compulsory standards and technical regulations. Regionally, the programme will support cooperation in harmonization, mutual recognition and equivalence of technical regulations to ease cross-border trade in goods. This will be through regional interventions to address country-specific requirements such as testing, labelling and certification. \n\nIn summary, the programme interventions will:\n1.\tIncrease regulatory coordination at the regional and international level to reduce multiplicity of mandatory quality requirements.\n2.\tImprove the capacity of firms and SMEs to comply with Standards and Technical Regulations for relevant markets\n3.\tEnhance the capacity of regulatory agencies (NSBs, FDAs and affiliate agencies) to enforce compliance to set Standards and Technical Regulations
