At Ruzizi 2 smaller-scale traders are underserved and prefer to use Ruzizi premier. Border offices on both sides of the border and the bridge will be upgraded.

The current cross border market facility will be upgraded on the Bukavu side of the border to accommodate traders’ needs. This simple structure will facilitate commerce at the border post. Currently many traders are forced to sell on the side of the road as existing infrastructure is full. The road connecting the border post to the city of Bukavu is in a poor condition and in need of upgrade to reduce the damage to vehicles, as well as time and cost of moving goods along a relatively short distance. Under this programme the section of road that feeds in Ruzizi 2 border post (approximately 2.7km long each), will be upgraded including all necessary earthworks drainage.

3874-WIT,USD,en,0,Support to Women Entrepreneurs,"The project specifically seeks to:
 (i) Increase access to information and trade support services: Small business owners (predominantly women) state that the several challenges including capacity needs, lack of professional services/skills, access to market information are hindrance to their ability to trade.  The project will aim to provide capacity in terms of skills and knowledge to enable women in selected value chains to trade formally, improve access finance and markets.  

 (ii)Increase trade value for women: According to studies, women trade in commodities with little or no value addition and are therefore disadvantaged as their returns on trade remain low. The project’s objective is to support women traders to access high value markets through trading in clusters/cooperatives and other groupings that support consolidation of resources and collective bargaining for cost reduction. The project will provide institutional capacity support to the Chamber of Women to enable it to provide much needed stewardship to women traders. 
The project with be implemented though a grant to Rwanda Women’s Chamber who are a national umbrella /apex representing women entrepreneurs.

1.	Regional Electronic Cargo and Driver Tracking System (RECDTS)
A digital-based solution that provides a trusted framework for sharing the mutually recognised EAC COVID-19 Test Certificates among Ministries of Health in the EAC, to facilitate movement of truck drivers across the region through elimination of multiple testing at entry points in the times of COVID-19. Support areas include;
a.	System development – including development of drivers, health, and enforcement officers mobile applications; geo-fencing of designated stop/rest areas along the major trade corridors in the EAC
b.	System integrations/interfaces to National Laboratory Systems. 
c.	System Infrastructure and operational support framework for the anchor platform (RECTS) - hosting support.
d.	Change management activities – sensitization/training of users (truck drivers, truck companies, health, and enforcement officers)

2.	Paperless border transactions
Enhancement of the SCT centralised platform to include automation of transit documents. This will limit the use of paper - a potential conduit of virus transmission, as well as limit human interaction in the times of COVID-19.

3.	Automatic identification and verification technologies (subject to availability of funds)
These will automate and further enhance clearance and release processes at border crossings, utilising technology to limit human interaction. These technologies will include;
a.	Smart gates. 
b.	Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

3571-EG,USD,en,0,Enhancing Market Access for Fresh Produce through Certification ,"The stringent international standards and dynamic market requirements remain an increasing impediment to export market access. The volume of horticulture exports to the EU market dropped by 30 per cent from 4,143 tons in the year 2014 to 3672 tons in the year 2015. Specifically, the volume of fresh vegetables exports from Kenya reduced by 7% compared to 2014.

3565-LH,USD,en,0,Mombasa Trade and Logistics Hub,"The Coastal region, comprising of about 4 million people, faces significant development challenges leading to widespread unemployment and poverty of 38% and 59% respectively. These are the 2nd highest unemployment and poverty rates in the country after North Eastern region which is mostly semi-arid occurs in a region with abundant land and sea resources that have not been fully exploited due to various challenges thereby resulting in tension, unemployment and civil strife due to economic underdevelopment and increasing sense of marginalization. 

These challenges have been compounded by collapse of key economic drivers like agriculture and fisheries, low factor productivity and overreliance on primary agricultural production for subsistence and domestic markets.

The Trade and Logistics Cluster approach seeks to establish a vision for the Coastal region based on higher value productive activities and providing a pathway to help the region achieve the necessary structural transformation from low value subsistence agricultural production to higher productivity through manufacturing for export, value addition activities and development of backward and forward value chains. Initial scoping study done by TMEA using World Bank Geospatial planning model, identified agribusiness, Textiles and apparel, and fisheries as the three key sectors with huge growth potential to generate employment, earn foreign exchange through exports, create high value markets for local farmers and new opportunities for local small and Medium Enterprises.

3514-MPBC,USD,en,0,Mombasa Port Berth Construction,"The comprehensive TMEA-funded berths condition assessment and rehabilitation study observed that Berths 11-14, constructed in the 1950s to service conventional cargo, were in critical condition, with foundational piles and the underlying berth structure severely corroded, compromising the safety of users. Furthermore, the berths are increasingly being used for container handling although they do not have the requisite equipment such as ship -to-shore gantry cranes. Consequently, only vessels with their own ship cranes use these berths, leading to low berth productivity levels. The berths originally were also equipped with warehouse facilities alongside the quayside. KPA has since removed the warehouses and paved the yards behind these Berths providing limited container yard storage capacity.

The Port of Mombasa is the principal gateway to the Eastern African region and serves a wide hinterland including the EAC countries of Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Northern Tanzania. The efficiency of the Port therefore has a major impact on the economies of the countries it serves and can unlock the region’s growth potential. However, if underdeveloped and with poor road access, it will remain a key constraint to trade and economic growth of the region.

The Mombasa West Integrated Urban Roads Network Project will be implemented in phases, the first of which is already approved and underway (expansion of Port Reitz Road and Airport Road). The proposed second and third phases will include: provision of an additional lane on either side of Kipevu Road and improvement of the existing two lanes on either side; modification of Gate 18 to facilitate the provision of additional three lanes at Gate 18; expansion of Magongo Road section from the Shell petrol station junction to Jomvu; provision of a Mombasa Port gate truck holding ground and expansion of airport road junction through Bomu Hospital to link Magongo road through to the Refinery road up to the Mombasa Nairobi.  All phases will be implemented through design and build contracts.

3410-WITRW,USD,en,0,Making Trade Work 4 Women in Rwanda - ProFemme,"The Rwanda programme has recorded significant success from the strategy I women and trade project specifically in the establishment of the cooperatives. This project will therefore build on this success and replicate good business models and lessons learned in the establishment of cooperatives for WCBT and replicate this for other segments like urban traders. Despite the significant results achieved in the ProFemme project facilitating women cross border traders in Rwanda to trade through cooperatives, other women traders continue to trade in low volumes and low value commodities and services which reduces the profitability of their trade. In strategy Il, this project will have a stronger focus on increasing trade in higher value goods so as to increase the trade value of the targeted traders/SMEs by addressing challenges faced in specific sectors/ value chains. The project will replicate the lessons learnt while the target group will be expanded to cover small and medium women owned enterprises to access export markets. The project specifically seeks to achieve the objectives below:
(i) Increase access to information and trade support services: Small business owners (predominantly women) state that the high tax burden in the formal sector forces them to operate informally. This is further demonstrated by the limited access to affordable finance for women traders. In 2011, 28.2% of women had bank accounts at formal financial institutions in comparison to 37.5% of men. Even where the Simplified Trade Regime is implemented, in order to benefit from the regime, an exporter must be VAT registered. Given that they trade informally, the majority are unable to meet this criterion. l The project will aim to provide capacity in terms of skills and knowledge to enable women in selected value chains to trade formally, improve access finance and markets.
(ii)lncrease trade value for women: The Rwanda National Cross Border Trade Strategy confirms that men trade primarily in capital intensive goods (e.g. manufactured goods), while women trade in commodities with little or no value addition and are therefore disadvantaged as their returns on trade remain low. The project's objective is to support women traders to access high value markets through trading in clusters/cooperatives and other groupings that support consolidation of resources and collective bargaining for cost reduction.",,,,2,2018/08/01,,2018/08/01,2023/06/30,4,23,TradeMark East Africa,,,,298,100,1,,33120,34,,,3,2019/10/31,250132,2019/12/31,The provided cumulative expenditure figures excludes the related overhead and project management costs for the period from 2019/10/31 to 2019/12/31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,2,2019/12/31,2019/12/31,0,2019/12/31,USD,,,,,,,,,,,

2702-TLIP,USD,en,0,Trade Logistics Information Pipeline (TLIP),"In international trade the supply chain that links the process of:  producing, manufacturing, moving and marketing of goods in international trade involves several business processes, regulatory documents, border formalities and logistics from sources of production to destination markets or consumption centres is highly complex, multi-layered and information intensive. The more borders cargo has to transit through, the more challenging it is to move the goods from source to destination.  The associated constraints with this kind of supply chain requires the establishment of seamless linkages among the supply chain actors to enable them to act more efficiently and transparently to lower the time and costs associated with the international trade process.

The programme aims at developing and implementing information sharing and exchange frameworks based on ICT to improve the information systems used by different supply chain actors by giving them direct access to relevant information. This will result in optimal transmission and use of information, enhanced visibility, improved transparency and predictability, and ultimately increase efficiency in the supply chains used by EATN businesses.  It will also contribute to improved competitiveness of EATN trade and in particular exports.",,,,2,2018/01/01,,2018/01/01,2022/06/30,4,23,TradeMark East Africa,,,,298,100,1,,33120,50,,,3,2020/04/30,319682,2020/06/30,The provided cumulative expenditure figures excludes the related overhead and project management costs for the period from 2020/04/30 to 2020/06/30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,2,2020/06/30,2020/06/30,0,2020/06/30,USD,,,,,,,,,,,

2604-SPS,USD,en,0,Trade Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Framework,"The SPS programme’s goal is to reduce SPS barriers to trade. It will work with SPS regulatory agencies in the different countries to enable them to successfully carry out their mandate to enforce compliance to SPS requirements. It will also support private economic actors to increase compliance with SPS requirements for key markets.  SPS Agencies will be supported to carry out effective export inspections so that the certificates issued are deemed to be enough. Various economic actors such as exporters and producers will be trained to acquire product certification to access priority export markets. The programme will therefore comprise of:
1.	Supporting economic actors at the national level to comply to SPS requirements for their target markets
2.	Building the capacity of national SPS agencies to enforce compliance to applicable SPS measures
3.	Strengthening Regional Cooperation in developing and implementing SPS measures
Sustainability will be in-built in the programme to ensure continuity and impact after TMEA interventions end. This will be through staff training and building financial self-sustenance into the programme design.",,,,2,2017/07/01,,2017/07/01,2023/06/30,4,23,TradeMark East Africa,,,,298,100,1,,33120,34,,,3,2019/10/31,46358,2019/12/31,The provided cumulative expenditure figures excludes the related overhead and project management costs for the period from 2019/10/31 to 2019/12/31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,2,2019/12/31,2019/12/31,0,2019/12/31,USD,,,,,,,,,,,

2603-STDS_SPS,USD,en,0,Standards and Quality Infrastructure,"Over the last 20 years, there has been a drive towards tariff reduction under the auspices of the WTO. As a result, there has been a 15% reduction in applied tariffs, resulting in the current average tariff of 9% applied by WTO members. Given the substantial reduction in tariffs, focus in trade facilitation has now shifted to non-tariff measures that impede trade, and in many cases, have a higher impact than the tariffs. Non-tariff measures include discriminatory regulations, procedures and fees that are sometimes used in a protectionist manner. There is also widespread use of quality parameters (also referred to as technical barriers to trade), that go beyond the legitimate requirements, and have the impact of impeding trade. These measures include standards, product specifications such as product characteristics, production methods, packaging or labelling, and related processes that are used to verify compliance. 

This programme aims to create an environment that supports compliance to Standards and Technical Regulations, without necessarily creating additional barriers to trade. Its aim is to enhance the capacity of regulatory agencies at the national levels, such as National Bureaux of Standards (NSBs), Food and Drug Agencies (FDAs), and other affiliate agencies, to enforce compliance to Standards and Technical Regulations, while facilitating trade. The programme also seeks to increase product, process and system certification for firms and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as a means to demonstrate compliance to voluntary and compulsory standards and technical regulations. Regionally, the programme will support cooperation in harmonization, mutual recognition and equivalence of technical regulations to ease cross-border trade in goods. This will be through regional interventions to address country-specific requirements such as testing, labelling and certification. 

In summary, the programme interventions will:
1.	Increase regulatory coordination at the regional and international level to reduce multiplicity of mandatory quality requirements.
2.	Improve the capacity of firms and SMEs to comply with Standards and Technical Regulations for relevant markets
3.	Enhance the capacity of regulatory agencies (NSBs, FDAs and affiliate agencies) to enforce compliance to set Standards and Technical Regulations ",,,,2,2017/07/01,,2017/07/01,2023/06/30,4,23,TradeMark East Africa,,,,298,100,1,,33120,34,,,3,2019/10/31,531560,2019/12/31,The provided cumulative expenditure figures excludes the related overhead and project management costs for the period from 2019/10/31 to 2019/12/31,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,2,2019/12/31,2019/12/31,0,2019/12/31,USD,,,,,,,,,,,
