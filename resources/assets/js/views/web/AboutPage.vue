            IATI Publisher enables organisations to publish data on activities
            and resource flows according to the IATI Standard. The IATI Standard
            is a set of rules and guidance on how to publish useful development
            and humanitarian data.

            IATI Publisher has been built to support organisations that publish
            a limited number of development and humanitarian activities. An
            ‘activity’ is an individual project or another unit of development
            and humanitarian work, which is determined by the organisation that
            is publishing the data. Organisations who publish a limited number
            of activities tend to represent small and medium sized
            organisations.

          <p class="mt-4 text-base">
            Large organisations, such as donor governments or UN agencies
            delivering 100+ activities are advised not to use IATI Publisher.
            Instead these organisations likely need to use an alternative
            technical solution that enables the publication of large volumes of
            data. Please email the IATI Helpdesk for more information:
